/**
 * Basic permissions are the building blocks of the permission-ing system in Sidecar. It offers more granular
 * permissions on specific targets which are listed here. The majority of Sidecar permissions are represented in
 * format {@code domain}:{@code action}.
 * <p>
 * For example, the SNAPSHOT:CREATE permission, CREATE action is allowed for the SNAPSHOT domain. Sample actions are
 * CREATE, READ, EDIT, DELETE, IMPORT, UPLOAD, START etc.
 * <p>
 * Domain aware permissions are supported with ':' wildcard parts divider. Wildcard token '*' is restricted
 * to avoid unpredictable behavior.
 * <p>
 * Some examples of domain aware permissions are:
 * - SNAPSHOT:CREATE,READ,DELETE allows SNAPSHOT:CREATE, SNAPSHOT:READ and SNAPSHOT:DELETE.
